*added a new revamped menu with a new option that allows you to change the amount of cycles so that in the case of not finding any repeating frequencies
	your computing device dosen't spiral into constantly trying to find something that doesn't exist.

*complete overhaul to the algorithm that was used in the previous version to solve the challenge in part 2, the previous version in its ideal form would 
	be more realistic to the scenario but at the same time was so much more complicated than the challenge that required solving.
