I coded this in c++
Just run the executable for the showcase of the program

Code is in the Source.cpp file in the second puzzle directory.
I used Visual Studio Community 2019vs.
I'm fairly certain that if you want to open the .sln file you have to use Visual Studio

The code should work with any amount of input as I used vectors which are dynamically created.


*spoiler alert* My code kept on claiming that there was no frequencies that ever appeared more than once so I hope that that was the right answer with the given input
I'm fairly confident in my code's ability to perform so i'm like 97% sure that I got it right.

I would have finished this last night on 6/19 but I was having so many bugs on a portion of code that I was writing to accomplish a goal that I didn't even realize
wasn't required so that feels bad.

As of right now the everything should work from all angles except for a few things
	*The frequencies.txt file has to be in the same directory as the executable
	*If you enter a new set of input into the frequencies.txt file while the program is running you have to enter in a wrong input in the menu and hit enter to repopulate
		the vectors
